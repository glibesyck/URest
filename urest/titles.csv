"'MEMOIRS of the Life and Poetry of William Wordsworth, with Extracts from his Letters to the Author, by Barron Field, Esqr. late Chief Justice of Gibraltar', in twelve chapters and three appendices (I and II in Vol. III, III in Vol. I). Three volumes. The first volume is the original MS. of the work, which is largely a compilation and was begun (according to a pencil note on f. 2) in 1836. Wordsworth, to whom it was submitted by the author and who, in a letter to Field of 16 Jan. 1840, deprecated publication, has added a number of comments in pencil on ff. 9b-126b passim. The more important of these, along with other passages, are quoted by W. Knight in The Life of William Wordsworth, 3 vols, 1889, being vols. ix-xi in his edition of The Poetical Works of William Wordsworth, 11 vols, 1882-1889. The other two MS S. contain Field's autograph fair copy (with alterations and additions) of chh. i-iii and iv-vi respectively. Appendix II consists of cuttings from Wordsworth's printed pamphlet on the Convention of Cintra, and is pasted down in the last volume, ff. 69-80b. Cf. Brit. Mus. Quart, i, 1926-1927, pp. 79-81. Paper; ff. v+316, 96, 80. Quarto. XIX cent. Belonged, when used by Knight, to the author's sister, Miss Maria L. Field, two of whose letters to Knight, of 5 and 10 Dec. 1883, are prefixed to Vol. I.

"CORRESPONDENCE Of Percy Bysshe Shelley and Miss Elizabeth Hitchener; 5 June, 1811-18 June, 1812. The correspondence covers the period of Shelley's first marriage (28 Aug. 1811), his residence at York and Keswick, his expedition to Ireland, and his return to Nantgwyllt and Cwm Elan in Radnorshire, and ends shortly before Miss Hitchenor's arrival to stay with the Shelleys at Lynmouth. It includes 44 letters from Shelley to Miss Hitchener, one from Mrs. Shelley (besides four additions to letters from her husband), and 12 letters from Miss Hitchener (9 to Shelley and 3 to Mrs. Shelley). There are also two sheets from Irish newspapers, bearing slight sketches and a few lines of writing by Shelley. Five of Shelley's letters contain verses, viz, 'Maiden, quench the glare of sorrow' (f. 57), 'She was an aged woman, and the years' (f. 78), 'The Devil went out a-walking one day' (f. 80 b), 'Brothers, between you and me' (f. 90), and a transcript of Wordsworth's 'Poet's Epitaph' (f. 76). At the beginning (f. 1) is a long note by W. M. Rossetti on the history of the correspondence, dated 2 Aug. 1874. A transcript of the correspondence, made by Rossetti, was used by Prof. E. Dowden for his Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley, 1886, and extracts from it are printed there. Edited by B. Dobell in 1908. Paper; ff. 123. Folio. Presented by the Rev. Charles Hargrove, to whom the letters were bequeathed in March, 1907, by Mr. Charlotte Mary Slack, of Croydon, with a requet that he would eventually bequeath them to the British Museum","","032-002053862","Fonds.

"LETTERS (19) from Dorothy Wordsworth and other members of the Wordsworth family to Catharine Clarkson, wife of Thomas Clarkson, the anti-slavery philanthropist; June (?) [1803]-May 1838. The topics dealt with are the same as those in the series in Add. MS. 36997, which the present letters supplement. A few extracts from Dorothy's letters are printed by Knight, Letters of the Wordsworth Family, 1907. A postscript by Wordsworth to Dorothy's letter of 22 Apr [1808] runs (f. 20 b): 'Wm Wordsworth in his own handwriting sends his best love to Catharine Clarkson.' One letter (f. 27) from Mrs. Clarkson to Dorothy Wordsworth, dated 'Xmas day 1814,' is included. At f. 35 is a portion of a letter from Mary Wordsworth, wife of the poet, written apparently from Rydal Mount early in May 1838 to Mrs. Clarkson, but addressed (following a direction endorsed upon it) and franked by J[ohn] Rickman, clerk assistant of the House of Commons, from London, 11 May 1838. It contains copies of three sonnets by Wordsworth: 'Hark! tis the Thrush, undaunted, undeprest' (dated 'Rydal Mount Easter Monday Evening 1838'), 'If with old love of you dear hills I share' (dated 'May morning 1838 Rydal Mount') and 'Life with yon lambs, like day, is just begun' (dated 'May-morning 1838'). For these sonnets (first printed in Sonnets of William Wordsworth, 1838) see The Poetical Works of W. Wordsworth, ed. Knight, viii, pp. 93, 95, 97, where variant readings from MS. sources are given. At the end (f. 36) is an undated letter from S[ara] H[utchinson] to Mrs. Clarkson. Paper; ff. 37. Folio. A.D [1803]-1838","","032-002093128","Fonds.
