# URest

*Urest* is a program which creates an unique small world for you with help of films and poetry.

## Idea and description

More and more people feel everyday stress and don't think about harmony inside.
My project tries to decrease the level of stress and anxiety by offering user some William Wordsworth's poetry and films based on the inputed pictures of nature. Moreover, user may find out some new information about author.

## Example of using

First of all, user should run the main.py. User will have an opportunity to find out additional information about books with William Wordsworth's biography. Then user should type places where he/she wants to be and program offers a list of films and a list of poetry which are based on the typed places and things.

*Take care of yourself!*
